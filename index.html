      SymmPI: Predictive Inference for Data with Group Symmetries </a>. Quantifying the uncertainty of predictions is a core problem in modern statistics. Various methods for predictive inference have been developed, such as conformal inference, relying on distributionally invariance assumption of the data after arbitrary permutations. However, this assumption can be violated due to the complex structures of the real world datasets, such as networks, rotationally invariant data, coordinate independent observations in physics. In this work, we propose <em> SymmPI</em>, a unified methodology for predictive inference when data distributions have general group symmetries and in arbitrary observation models. We show that SymmPI has valid coverage and characterize its performance under distribution shift, admitting many existing results as special cases.

      Test-Negative Designs with Multiple Testing Sources </a>. Previously, Test-Negative Design (TND) studies focused primarily on individuals who sought testing due to symptoms consistent with the disease, aiming to reduce confounding factors associated with healthcare-seeking behavior. However, in scenarios like COVID-19, and Ebola, testing was employed for various reasons, including contact tracing, irrespective of symptoms. Traditional odds ratio estimator introduces bias when assessing intervention efficacy. To this end, we propose an approach to study the vaccine effect by combining both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals.<br/>

	      	  	  	  	   <li>   New Paper Out: Previous studies on parametric ranking models mostly assume comparison graphs are derived from a specific random graph, using either the spectral method or the MLE, without quantifying the uncertainty of ranks. In this paper, 1. We study a very general and more
realistic setup in which the comparison graph consists of hyper-edges of possible heterogeneous
sizes. 2. We build a connection between the spectral method and MLE: a two-step spectral method, applying the optimal weighting estimated from the equal weighting vanilla spectral method, can achieve the same asymptotic efficiency as the MLE. 3. We provide a comprehensive framework on both one and two-sample ranking inferences, applicable to both fixed and random graph settings.

	  <li>  Despite extensive studies on ranking, few prior literatures investigate this problem under the more realistic setting where covariate information exists. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel model, Covariate-Assisted Ranking Estimation (CARE) model, that extends the well-known Bradley- Terry-Luce (BTL) model, by incorporating the covariate information For more details, please check out our new paper:   <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09961">

	  	        <li>  The existing developments in studying robust statistics for large-scale experiments, such as Winsorization, Huberization and median of means require the bounded second moments and involve variable-dependent tuning parameters, which hamper their fidelity in applications to large-scale problems. To solve such issue, we propose tuning-free and moment-free high-dimensional inference procedures based on Hodges-Lehmann estimator for testing global null and for large-scale multiple testing with false discovery proportion control.

      When is best subset selection the "best"?</a> <em>(July, 2020)</em> <br/> 
      <p>
      This work (joint with Jianqing Fan and Yongyi Guo) characterizes when best subset selection and its computational surrogate based on iterative hard thresholding (IHT) achieve exact model recovery and sure screening under high-dimensional sparse linear models. In the simulation study, IHT substantially outperforms LASSO, SCAD and SIS in terms of FDR and TPR, in particular in the presence of strong colinearity of design.
